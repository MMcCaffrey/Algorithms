# Algorithms

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks exploring various algorithms and Python files for import and use in other projects. I may also use this as a place to drop any coding challenges (e.g., Fizz Buzz).

### Algorithms Illuminated (Roughgarden 2017)
I am working my way through the first volume of [*Algorithms Illuminated*](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Illuminated-Part-1-Basics-ebook/dp/B075YQP38X/) by [Tim Roughgarden](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/) (2017). The book is language neutral, with all algorithms explained in pseudo-code, so I'm building out each example in Python.
